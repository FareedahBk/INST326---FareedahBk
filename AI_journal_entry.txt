Week 1
09/14/2025
This week I used AI, Chatgpt specifically, to review basic python concepts. I asked my AI chat if I was supposed to put my string in quotation marks when creating a variable because I couldn't remember whether or not I needed them. Then, I asked for chat to show me how to structure a f-string. 
When I got to exercise #6, I asked my AI chat to explain the instructions of what I was suppposed to code. Here is my AI chat link : https://chatgpt.com/c/68c76c1b-0788-832d-9994-7a0f6215c409 

Week 2
9/19/2025
This week I used ChatGPT to explain some python concepts that were new to me. I have never seen the reverse or sort command before this exercise. I was able to read about the commands and then use what I had read to complete my code. I also asked for Chat to explain the difference betweena For and While loop because I sometimes get their usefullness mixed up.

Week 3
9/28/2025
This week I used ChatGPT to clarify certain terms in the assignment instructions. I wanted to know the difference between "case_sensitive = True" and "case_sensitive = False". After reading ChatGPT's explanation, I understood what I was supposed to do. I've notice that in order to fulfill these requiremnts , I just need to break down the instructions for my understanding. Then, I used ChatGPT to help me find the error in my code.

Week 5
10/12/2025
This week I used AI as a helping hand in understanding feautres in python. I've briefly used isinstance() before and I wanted to see how I could implment it to get the result that I needed which was a string value only. Then I asked chatgpt to tell me the difference between a single underscore and double underscores in encapuslation. Finally, when I am typing code, I tend to overlook the small things. My code would not run properly due to a typo that AI pointed out for me.  https://chatgpt.com/c/68ec159c-5710-832c-bad0-943e8e9c30dd
